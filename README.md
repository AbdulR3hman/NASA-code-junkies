Description:
		There are 4 stages of this project:

		1- GUI (user interface) which helps the user to navigate of available list of shuttles to locate near objects.
		2- The GUI also includes an animation part of the GUI where earth, satellites and shuttles aresimulated in real time.
		3- Orbits equations that bounds the shuttle objects and the satellites objects (this part we call the physics engine )
		4- Interfacing all the previous 3 stages done at the end of the project through wrapper classes and others.

		The project is built in Java; utilizing Java3D library as well as others.


We have established for now:

		-- Full GUI interface ready to be hooked to back-end functions. 
		-- Finished simulating Earth, Sat math models 
		-- Finished animating Earth, Sat graphic models 
		-- All the above stages have been interfaced


Future Improvements:

		-- Fix the rotation [Done]
		-- Add Shuttle as part of the animations [Done]
		-- Others!


Drawbacks:

		-- Collision Detection System is needed
		-- 2D mathematical modelling where 3D is more practical and realistic



Future Commitments:

		The team is very keen to keep developing this application...


From Team Code Junckies: "Happy Coding"
