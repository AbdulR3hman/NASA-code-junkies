Description:
		There are 4 stages of this project:

		1- GUI (user interface) which helps the user to navigate of available list of shuttles to loca		      te near objects.
		2- The GUI also includes an animation part of the GUI where earth, satellites and shuttles are 		      simulated in real time.
		3- Orbits equations that bounds the shuttle objects and the satellites objects (this part we c		      all the physics engine )
		4- Interfacing all the previous 3 stages done at the end of the project through wrapper classe		      s and others.

		The project is built in Java; utilizing Java3D library as well as others.


We have established for now:

		-- Full GUI interface ready to be hooked to back-end functions. 
		-- Finished simulating Earth, Sat math models 
		-- Finished animating Earth, Sat graphic models 
		-- All the above stages have been interfaced


Future Improvements:
		-- Fix the routation
		-- Add Shuttle as part of the animations




For Team: Code Junckies "Happy Coding"

Notice: All authors were present in person at York University - Computer Science School at the time of the challenge...
